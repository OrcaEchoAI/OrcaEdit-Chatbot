# Privacy Policy for Orcarina

**Orcarina** is a Google Slides‚Ñ¢ add-on that provides an AI assistant directly within the Slides‚Ñ¢ interface to help users brainstorm ideas, refine text, and improve presentation content.

---

### üß† Information Handling
- Messages you type into the chat panel are securely transmitted to our backend for processing through **Google Gemini‚Ñ¢** models.  
- The add-on does **not** access, read, or modify the content of your **Google Slides‚Ñ¢** presentations.  
- Orcarina uses a limited **Google Drive‚Ñ¢ file scope (`drive.file`)** solely to meet **Google Workspace Marketplace‚Ñ¢** integration requirements. It may read basic metadata of the presentation you explicitly open with the add-on to confirm context; it never reads or stores slide content.  
- No user data is used beyond what‚Äôs necessary to generate AI responses during your active session.  

---

### ü§ñ Use of Google Gemini
- AI responses are powered by the **Gemini API via Google Cloud‚Ñ¢**.  
- In accordance with Google Cloud‚Ñ¢ data privacy terms, customer data is **not used for model training** unless the customer or organization has explicitly opted in.  
- End users retain full control over their own Google Account settings and data-usage preferences related to Gemini‚Ñ¢.  

---

### üóëÔ∏è Data Retention and Sharing
- Orcarina does **not** permanently store your chat history or personal data.  
- No personal information is sold, shared, or disclosed to third parties.  
- Logs used for short-term debugging are automatically deleted after limited retention consistent with standard security practices.
