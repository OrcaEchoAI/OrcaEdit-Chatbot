# Orcarina – AI Assistant for Google Slides™

**Orcarina** is a Google Slides™ add-on that brings an AI-powered assistant directly into your slide-creation workflow.  
Stay in the flow while getting instant help brainstorming ideas, refining slide text, and enhancing clarity — all within Google Slides™.

### ✨ Key Features
- Open a side chat panel while editing in **Google Slides™**  
- Ask **Orcarina** to suggest titles, talking points, or slide summaries  
- Generate creative phrasing or bullet points instantly  
- Lightweight, privacy-first design — no complicated setup required  

---

### 🔒 Privacy by Design
- Orcarina does **not** access, read, or modify the content of your **Google Slides™**  
- Orcarina uses a limited Google Drive™ file scope solely to meet Google Workspace Marketplace™ integration requirements.  
  It may read basic metadata of the presentation you explicitly open with the add-on to confirm context; it never reads or stores slide content.  
- Messages are processed securely via **Google Gemini™** to generate responses
